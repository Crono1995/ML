Explanation:
Importing Libraries:

pandas is used for data manipulation.
DecisionTreeClassifier is the decision tree model used for classification.
train_test_split is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
metrics provides methods for evaluating the performance of the model.
LabelEncoder is used to convert categorical variables into numerical values.
Loading Data:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and assigned custom column names.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Categorical columns (company, job, degree) are transformed into numerical values using LabelEncoder.
Defining Features and Target:

feature_cols are the independent variables (features) used to predict the target.
y is the dependent variable (target), in this case, salary.
Splitting the Dataset:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 20% reserved for testing.
Training the Model:

A Decision Tree classifier is initialized with entropy as the criterion (which measures the quality of a split using information gain) and a maximum depth of 2.
The model is trained on the training data.
Making Predictions:

Predictions are made on the test set.
Evaluating the Model:

The accuracy of the model is calculated and printed, indicating how well the model's predictions match the actual values.
